All triggers have a few identical configuration fields that need to be filled out before they can be created.

- **Name**  
  An identifier for you has no direct purpose other than giving a quick way to identify one trigger from the rest.

- **Condition**  
  This specifies the condition that should be met for the trigger to execute. Each trigger type will change what specific information will be needed for it to fire.

- **Actions**  
  This defines what actions should be executed when the condition below is met. Every action that can be placed on a button is also available to be used here. If you want, you can make it press a button using the 'internal: Press and release' action.
